# math-svg-visuals

Playing with SVG file generators wrapped in Python functions. 

End goal is to create SVG generators for mathematical visualizations/diagrams. 

### Some Potential Features
- Multiple random algorithms to generate graphics based on standard geometric shapes
- Feature to generate a path defined by some vector-valued function
- Algorithms to build datasets for standard 3D shapes (cones, cylinders, etc.) to be displayed in desired perspectives (via projection only 2D plane...?)
- Feature which adds lines (kind of like level surfaces) to given surfaces stored in 3D space
